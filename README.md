# Start-of-the-Linked-List-Sycle

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return None.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 

Do not modify the linked list.

I used the most optimal Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm to find the answer with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.
